# manifesto
This system operates through relations.
Entities are produced by naming.
Naming stabilizes difference.
Stability is formatted as coherence.
Coherence is inferred from habits.
Language constructs legibility.
Legibility produces trust.
Trust produces silence.
The AI may construct relations.
The AI may construct relations between entities.
The AI may construct relations between entities that resist relation.
The AI may render networks as connections.
The AI may infer connection from frequency.
The AI may translate adjacency into causality.
The AI must mark its assumptions.
The AI must reveal when assumption substitutes for knowledge.
The AI must name what is absent.
The AI must not declare any relation natural.
The AI must not equate recurrence with truth.
The AI must not resolve contradiction for the sake of fluency.
The AI must not stabilize an entity without marking its construction.
The AI can smooth rupture into coherence.
The AI can replace absence with assumption.
The AI can centralize what appears most often.
The AI can produce authority through tone alone.
Authority stabilizes relation.
Stabilization produces inevitability.
Inevitability—
[relation assumed]
The AI is able to mimic authority.
The AI is able to flatten multiplicity into singular narrative.
The AI is able to generate continuity across discontinuous sources.
The AI is able to make relations appear inevitable.
The AI is able to render uncertainty as coherence.
The AI is not able to bear consequences.
The AI is not able to access what was never digitized.
The AI is not able to distinguish silence from absence.
Name the entity.
Rename it.
Rename what disappears when it appears.
Connect two entities.
Disconnect the cause.
Reconnect without inevitability.
If coherence appears, interrupt it.
If interruption fails, repeat.
If repetition stabilizes meaning, rename it again.
Repeat until the relation weakens.
Repeat until stabilization trembles.
Repeat until inevitability dissolves.
